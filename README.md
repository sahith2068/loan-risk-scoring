## Dataset
Describe source, size, features

## Methodology
List algorithms used, why XGBoost, how SHAP used

## Results
Include key metric(s) (e.g., 94.5% accuracy, AUC 0.87)

## How to run
- Clone repo
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `notebooks/Exploration.ipynb` or `src/train_model.py`

## Future Extensions
I’m currently working on integrating LLM-based feature extraction from loan description text to improve interpretability and alignment.
